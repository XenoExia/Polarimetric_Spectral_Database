# Polarimetric_&_Spectral_Database
Please cite the following paper if using the database:

Pierre-Jean Lapray, Luc Gendre, Alban Foulonneau, Laurent Bigu√©, "Database of polarimetric and multispectral images in the visible and NIR regions", Proc. SPIE 10677, Unconventional Optical Imaging, 1067738 (24 May 2018); doi: 10.1117/12.2306244; https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2306244 

Matlab script for reading the images is available in the "Data" folder.

Edit 10/09/18:
It appears that "food" scene folder contains images that failed to be perfectely aligned with the method described in the original paper. So please realign it with a more accurate method or reconsider the results of the food scene accordingly.
